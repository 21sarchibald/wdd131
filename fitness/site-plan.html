			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>

The website will store their stats for each workout and calculate their total calorie and protein intake for the day.</p>

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>The website is made for people consistently looking for a place to track their daily activities and health achievements. It can be used of people of almost any age; it is intended for people who are consistently working out and wanting to track progress.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>The workout page will provide a form with input fields to input the type of exercise, the name of the exercise, repetitions, and when the user did the exercise. The user can then submit the form, which will add it to a record of their workouts.</p>
            <p>The food tracking page will provide a form with input fields to input the food, calories, and protein of each meal they eat. Just like the workout page, the form can be submitted and added to a list of the foods eaten for that day.</p>
            <p>The pages will also contain light and dark modes that can be toggled on and off.</p>
